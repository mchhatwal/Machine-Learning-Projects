## Welcome to My Coding Portfolio!

Below, you can see the different data science projects I have completed so far. 

### Real Estate Tycoon

The aim of this project was to build a model that could accurately predict housing prices based on numerous different features, such as house size, location, and surrounding amenities. Throughout the project, I fitted and plotted numerous different models, comparing each of them to ultimately identify the most accurate model to predict house price.
